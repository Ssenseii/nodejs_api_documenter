### **Automated API Documentation Generator with Testing Integration**

### **Project Overview:**

Create an automated API documentation generator that integrates with your Express.js routes. The tool will not only generate detailed documentation for your API endpoints but also include automated testing capabilities to ensure that your API remains functional and meets the specifications outlined in the documentation.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Route Scanning & Documentation Generation:**
    - Automatically scan your Express.js routes to generate API documentation.
    - Extract route methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), paths, parameters, request bodies, and responses.
    - Generate a user-friendly HTML or Markdown documentation file that developers can easily read and understand.
2. **Automated Testing Integration:**
    - Create test cases for each API route based on the extracted documentation.
    - Run these tests automatically whenever the API documentation is generated or updated.
    - Report any discrepancies between the documentation and the actual API behavior.
3. **Custom Middleware for Documentation Annotations:**
    - Allow developers to add custom annotations or comments in the route definitions to enhance the generated documentation.
    - Support for tagging routes (e.g., `@deprecated`, `@auth-required`, `@role:admin`).
4. **Interactive Documentation Interface:**
    - Optionally, build an interactive Swagger-like UI where developers can try out the API endpoints directly from the documentation.
    - Provide a web interface for running the tests and viewing the results.
5. **Versioning Support:**
    - Track changes to the API over time by supporting multiple versions of the documentation.
    - Automatically compare current API behavior with previous versions to detect breaking changes.
6. **Environment Configuration:**
    - Allow configuration of different environments (development, staging, production) for testing the API, ensuring that tests run correctly in various contexts.

### **Benefits for You as a Developer:**

1. **Enhanced API Quality:** Automated testing ensures that your API functions as expected, reducing bugs and improving reliability.
2. **Time Savings:** The tool automates the tedious task of writing and maintaining API documentation, allowing you to focus on building features.
3. **Better Collaboration:** Well-documented APIs make it easier for other developers to understand and use your API, improving team collaboration.
4. **Skill Development:** Building this tool will deepen your understanding of Express.js, middleware, testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest, and API design principles.
5. **Reusable Component:** Once built, this tool can be reused in future projects, making it easier to document and test any API you develop.

### **Steps to Build the Project:**

1. **Setup Express.js:**
    - Initialize an Express.js project and set up your route structure.
    - Create some sample routes to work with.
2. **Route Scanning:**
    - Write a module that introspects your Express routes, extracting methods, paths, and handler functions.
    - Use the Express `app._router.stack` to access the route definitions.
3. **Documentation Generation:**
    - Create a documentation generator that takes the route data and converts it into HTML or Markdown files.
    - Implement a templating system (e.g., using EJS or Handlebars) to structure the documentation.
4. **Testing Integration:**
    - Write a testing module that uses a testing framework like Mocha, Chai, or Jest to generate and run tests for each route.
    - Include positive and negative test cases based on the route specifications (e.g., valid vs. invalid parameters).
5. **Custom Middleware for Annotations:**
    - Develop a middleware that allows developers to add annotations directly in their route definitions.
    - Parse these annotations to enhance the documentation with additional details like required authentication or special route behaviors.
6. **Interactive Documentation UI:**
    - Optionally, use a library like Swagger UI to generate an interactive front-end for your documentation.
    - Integrate it with your testing module so developers can run tests directly from the documentation interface.
7. **Version Control:**
    - Implement a versioning system that tracks changes to your API and generates separate documentation for each version.
    - Add comparison tools to detect and highlight breaking changes between versions.
8. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your tool as a standalone service or integrate it directly into your existing Express.js projects.
    - Provide a simple command-line interface (CLI) for generating documentation and running tests.
